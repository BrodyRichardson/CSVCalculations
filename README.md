# CSVCalculations
This code reads a CSV file containing pairs of numbers, and calculates the sum, difference, product, and quotient of each pair. The results are then written to a new CSV file.

Input
The input file, numbers.csv, must contain pairs of numbers, with one pair per row. The first row should be a header row, with descriptive names for the columns.

Output
The output file, results.csv, will contain the calculated results, with headers for each column. The columns are named "Sum", "Difference", "Product", and "Quotient".

Usage
To run this code, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can then run the code using the following command:

Copy code
python csv_processing.py
Dependencies
This code uses the built-in csv module in Python, so no additional dependencies are required.
